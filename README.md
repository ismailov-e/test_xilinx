VectorBlox MXP Preview
======================

The VectorBlox MXP Matrix Processor is an FPGA-based soft processor
capable of highly parallel execution. Programmed entirely in C/C++,
the MXP is capable of executing data-parallel software algorithms at
hardware-like speeds. MXP's parametrized design lets the user specify
the amount of parallelism required, ranging from 1 to 128 or more
parallel ALUs. Key features of the MXP include a parallel-access
scratchpad memory to hold vector data and a high-throughput DMA
engine.

Our preview release consists of: 

- Prebuilt bitstreams to evaluate the MXP processor on several popular
  FPGA development boards
- Software Development Kit 
- Example programs
- Documentation

To get started immediately:

- Ensure you have one of the [supported development
  boards](http://vectorblox.github.io/test_xilinx/mxp_xilinx_boards.html).
- Clone this repository or use the Download ZIP button.
- Follow the [Xilinx Quickstart](http://vectorblox.github.io/test_xilinx/mxp_xilinx_preview.html).
